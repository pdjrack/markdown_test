# Learning Markdown
## Journey Begins <p style="text-align:right">May 19,2024</p> 
As I begin to understand the importance of simplifying an already difficult process, _of developing manuals and standard operating procedures (SOP)_, it is important to find a universal tool.  By universal, I mean a tool that can be translated into any format from PDF to html. So now the purpose is established let's move on.  
So far the only drawback I have seen with the markdown language is the spell check is not already currently present in this VS code IDE that I am typing in.  This may be a pro though, because it causes you to concentrate on your writing and not on the **red or blue** underlines that appear in word documents as you type, such as Microsoft Word. <ins>I will research and see my options.</ins>
